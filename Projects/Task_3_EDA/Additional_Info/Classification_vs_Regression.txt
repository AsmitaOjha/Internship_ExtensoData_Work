What Are Classification and Regression Algorithms?
These are two types of supervised machine learning algorithms, used to predict outcomes based on data.

1. Classification Algorithms
Purpose: Predict a category or class (e.g., True/False, Spam/Not Spam, Fraud/Not Fraud).

Output: Discrete values (labels or categories).

Examples:
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest
-K-Nearest Neighbors
-Support Vector Machine
-Naive Bayes

In your fraud detection dataset, predicting isFraud (True/False) is a classification problem.

2. Regression Algorithms
Purpose: Predict a continuous numeric value (e.g., price, age, transaction amount).
Output: Real numbers.

Examples:
-Linear Regression
-Decision Tree Regressor
-Random Forest Regressor
-Gradient Boosting Regressor

Use case for you: If you wanted to predict transactionAmount based on other features, that would be a regression problem.
