Awesome, Asmita! Let’s break down these important concepts so your preprocessing step is crystal clear.

## 1️⃣ What is **train\_test\_split** and why do we use it?

* **Purpose:** To evaluate how well your machine learning model performs on new, unseen data.
* **What it does:** Splits your dataset into two parts:

  * **Training set:** Used to train the model (learn patterns).
  * **Testing set:** Used to test how well the model generalizes (predicts on data it has never seen before).

By splitting, you avoid **overfitting** (model memorizing the data) and get a realistic estimate of performance.

## 2️⃣ What is **One-Hot Encoding**?

* It’s a method to convert **categorical variables** (like `'merchantCountryCode'` or `'transactionType'`) into numeric format, because machine learning models **need numbers** to process data.
* **How it works:** For each category in a column, it creates a new binary (0 or 1) column.

Example:

| Color |
| ----- |
| Red   |
| Blue  |
| Green |

One-hot encoded becomes:

| Color\_Red | Color\_Blue | Color\_Green |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1          | 0           | 0            |
| 0          | 1           | 0            |
| 0          | 0           | 1            |

## 3️⃣ Why do we convert categorical variables to numeric?

* Most machine learning algorithms **cannot work directly with text or categorical data**.
* Models rely on **mathematical calculations** which require numbers.
* Converting categories to numeric form allows algorithms to learn relationships and patterns in your data.

## Summary:

| Concept                           | Why?                                      | What it does                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **train\_test\_split**            | To fairly evaluate your model             | Splits data into train and test parts            |
| **One-Hot Encoding**              | ML needs numbers, not text                | Converts categories into multiple binary columns |
| **Convert categories to numeric** | To feed categorical data to ML algorithms | Enables mathematical processing by algorithms    |

Would you like me to show you a code example on how to do these steps with your dataset next?
