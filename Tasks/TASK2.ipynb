    " \"I want to design a **Core Banking System** that facilitates seamless transactions while also ensuring that analytical data is preserved for reporting and insights. The system should be designed with a robust database structure using **MySQL** and implemented in **Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transactional Capabilities:**\n",
    "   - Handling deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments.\n",
    "   - Maintaining account balances and ensuring data consistency.\n",
    "   - Implementing security and authorization mechanisms(as simple as you can).\n",
    "2. **Analytical Data Storage:**\n",
    "   - Storing historical transaction data for trend analysis.\n",
    "   - Capturing customer behavior for insights and reporting.\n",
    "   - Designing optimized tables for efficient querying.\n",
    "3. **System Design Requirements:**\n",
    "   - **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to represent the database structure.\n",
    "   - **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** to show the flow of transactions and data processing.\n",
    "   - **Prototype Implementation** using **MySQL database** and **Python** for backend processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ERD and DFD representations.\n",
    "- SQL database schema for MySQL.\n",
    "- Python implementation with basic workflow for transactions.\n",
    "- A sample dashboard or reporting module for analytics."
